An example config file has been placed in rel/config.exs, review it,
make edits as needed/desired, and then run `mix release` to build the release
```

## Get to Know the Author
**André Albuquerque**
is a software engineer at Onfido, after working in the banking industry for seven years. He has a master's degree from Instituto Superior Técnico in distributed systems and software engineering, and, during his banking detour, he obtained a master's degree in economics. He is currently developing Onfido's microservices using Elixir and Ruby, learning every day about how applications can score and scale if we apply the correct tools and sound coding practices from the get-go. In his time off, he loves to
build his own keyboards, play basketball, and spend time with his wife and son.


**Daniel Caixinha**
is a software engineer at Onfido, where he is using Elixir to build resilient systems that can also handle the high growth of the business. After graduating from Instituto Superior Técnico, he joined the startup world, mainly using Ruby, but also got the chance to play around with Elixir. Upon joining Onfido, he got the chance to take Elixir more seriously, which made him fall in love with functional programming in general, and Elixir in particular. Besides building Elixir applications, he is fostering the use of Elixir,
being also a member of the Lisbon Elixir meetup.
